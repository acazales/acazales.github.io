## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 2. Part 1
This lab was fun because we implemented strings and user input into our code. Creating fun sentences and utilizing what we were learning in class at the time. As well as using line wrapping, and I was learning how to become comfortable with reading code and formatting it as well. This lab was very enjoyable. It felt good being able to create this.


Lab 6, part 1
This lab was fun as well with the use of “command_line.size” code. This lab was fun as well by using the argument code, to create a sandwich! With bread protein and condiments. This lab was one of our first uses of vectors. I enjoyed this lab and learning how and what I can use these arguments for. I reflected on my own knowledge and what I could do and couldn't do or understand, so I asked for help and I learned from that. What I've learned is that help is nothing to be afraid of, if you don't know something just keep learning. You learn from failure.


Lab 4, part 1
This lab was a challenge, but I was relieved to be able to figure it out. Converting tbsp to ML, and cups. It was a challenge, me and my partner were confused and had to ask for help. I learned to never be afraid to ask for help, to not suffer in silence. It was such a challenging program. But I reflect on this lab, and I have used this to expand my own knowledge and others knowleged when they ask if I understand similar code.
